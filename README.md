**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Set up an optical Fourier transform system to analyze the transform patterns of various images, alphabets, and numbers. Compare the experimental results with MATLAB simulations to validate findings and ensure the accuracy of the frequency domain representation. This project aims to understand the correlation between optical and simulated data for different visual inputs.
